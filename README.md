# Recursion-Game

This file includes the game of anagram and Sierpinski as well as helps me build the strong basic knowledge in Recursion.

(1) Anagram 

   -> If user inputs a word, this program helps you find out all the anagrams of the words.
            
            Input: stop
            Anagrams:[stop, spot, top, opts, post, pots]
    
    
(2) Sierpinski
  
  -> This file draws a picture of Sierpinski Triangle, which was invented by Polish Mathematician Waclaw Sierpinki.
      
   I used the concept of self-similarity to draw this picture.
      
   The picture of Sierpinski Triangle:
